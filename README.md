# workshop_2_example

link for examples:https://cona0131.github.io/workshop_2_example/

Here are three examples Iâ€˜ve done after I learnt form the workshop2.
tried makeBlueCircle
different colours
mousePressed
setInterval, setTimeout

When I change none to main from the setting, the link I got is not for the code live view, they are all the link of showing Readme page. ;(
